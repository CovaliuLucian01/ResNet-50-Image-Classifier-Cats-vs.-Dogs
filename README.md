# ResNet-50-Image-Classifier-Cats-vs.-Dogs
This project implements an image classification model using ResNet-50 to distinguish between cats and dogs. The dataset includes clean, noisy, and combined images to test the model's robustness. Preprocessing steps, transfer learning, and performance analysis are covered, along with a GUI-based testing framework for interactive evaluation.
